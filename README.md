# research-level-altmetrics
This repository has the data and code for a [3:AM Conference](http://altmetricsconference.com/tag/3am/) presentation. We look at the distribution and character of altmetrics at the level of individual researchers, using a novel dataset based on ORCID profiles.

You can read [the working version of our blog post in this repository](https://github.com/Impactstory/research-level-altmetrics/blob/master/post.md); this will eventually (hopefully) mature into a more polished version to be posted on the ArXiv.
